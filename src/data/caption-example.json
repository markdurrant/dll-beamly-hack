I think they'll make a profit.","broadcast_time":1399731465000},{"text":"Yes, absolutely, but slimline is the way forward, Phil. Is it?","broadcast_time":1399731460000},{"text":"Next is the pair of toast racks. I think they're lovely. Small bits of toast, mind.

Yeah.","broadcast_time":1399731449000},{"text":"If it hasn't got good, clear marks, and has got a bit of damage - it's been well used...

That would be good. Off you trot.","broadcast_time":1399731407000},{"text":"Well, I thought I might see if I can buy some...copper!","broadcast_time":1399731404000},{"text":"And are you going to perform?","broadcast_time":1399731399000},{"text":"You can get quite a lot for 100 quid.

Ah!","broadcast_time":1399731253000},{"text":"So it doesn't hurt the hand when you sit on it. That is illustrated by this darkening here.","broadcast_time":1399731250000},{"text":"If look around underneath as well. The way it's finished on the edges is rather nice, bevelled.","broadcast_time":1399731244000},{"text":"It's rather good at this end.

ÃÂ£40-ÃÂ£60. ÃÂ£60 paid.","broadcast_time":1399729849000},{"text":"So you could get that one sold to a Greek. We live in hope.","broadcast_time":1399729844000},{"text":"He could put it in his pocket, certainly in his suitcase. Yes.","broadcast_time":1399729842000},{"text":"I don't know if he's got a shipping line or not.","broadcast_time":1399729838000},{"text":"so I was trying to suggest that this could be the ideal purchase.","broadcast_time":1399729835000},{"text":"Yes, and he wants a cabinet or chest to display his coins on,","broadcast_time":1399729831000},{"text":"We had a gentleman in a few moments ago from Greece... No!","broadcast_time":1399729828000},{"text":"I'd rather move it that size than full size.","broadcast_time":1399729825000},{"text":"Erm... I'd rather have it that size than full size.","broadcast_time":1399729822000},{"text":"I quite like that in a bizarre sort of way.","broadcast_time":1399729819000},{"text":"What about the armoire?","broadcast_time":1399729816000},{"text":"Is that your estimate, ÃÂ£20-ÃÂ£40? Yes. ÃÂ£42, they paid.","broadcast_time":1399729813000},{"text":"No. So for me, that's very much a...","broadcast_time":1399729809000},{"text":"when that could buy an 18th-century Worcester tea bowl and I can't see the comparison.","broadcast_time":1399729806000},{"text":"Coming from Worcester, I have a problem looking at that at ÃÂ£20-ÃÂ£40","broadcast_time":1399729801000},{"text":"Do they? Bird spotting. Pheasant shooting? That type of thing.","broadcast_time":1399729796000},{"text":"It's a pheasant.

You can't beat it enough.","broadcast_time":1399729790000},{"text":"Beswick pottery. Your favourite subject, I know.","broadcast_time":1399729787000},{"text":"ÃÂ£30 paid.","broadcast_time":1399729783000},{"text":"Er, it's a latter-day market.

Very cunning.","broadcast_time":1399729771000},{"text":"He's of course got high hopes, you know, the usual,","broadcast_time":1399729768000},{"text":"That's not too bad. ÃÂ£80 was paid by David Barby.","broadcast_time":1399729764000},{"text":"That's fair enough. I think they should make ÃÂ£50-ÃÂ£80.","broadcast_time":1399729761000},{"text":"And illuminate your writing. Illuminate your darkness.","broadcast_time":1399729758000},{"text":"you'd fit that to a bracket so your candles would fit either side.","broadcast_time":1399729755000},{"text":"So perhaps an architect's desk or a bureau, instead of having a candle slide,","broadcast_time":1399729752000},{"text":"Erm, it's a fitting to go onto a fitting.","broadcast_time":1399729747000},{"text":"What do you reckon this is all about? It's odd, isn't it?","broadcast_time":1399729744000},{"text":"Are these going to light up your life? I quite like them.","broadcast_time":1399729741000},{"text":"But for the audience at home, let's find out what the auctioneer thinks.","broadcast_time":1399729738000},{"text":"You're absolutely right, Eve. You'll decide after the sale of your first three items.","broadcast_time":1399729733000},{"text":"We don't have to go with them. We'll see how badly we do first!","broadcast_time":1399729727000},{"text":"Look, that's only a tank full of petrol. It's nothing. True.","broadcast_time":1399729722000},{"text":"ÃÂ£80.","broadcast_time":1399729718000},{"text":"But those sections are later. How much were they, David?","broadcast_time":1399729716000},{"text":"There'd be something there so it would mount onto a wall. Oh, right.","broadcast_time":1399729713000},{"text":"It would be the other way. It's quite tactile. Like this.","broadcast_time":1399729710000},{"text":"I can't see that going on a wall, can you?","broadcast_time":1399729706000},{"text":"Faint praise, Eve, methinks.","broadcast_time":1399729703000},{"text":"I think I do. Ah!","broadcast_time":1399729701000},{"text":"or something like that. Do you like them?","broadcast_time":1399729698000},{"text":"But it must have acted somewhat as a sort of wall-mounting sconce","broadcast_time":1399729696000},{"text":"which has been put on, I think, later.","broadcast_time":1399729692000},{"text":"and underneath there's this interesting metal section there,","broadcast_time":1399729689000},{"text":"Now, I rather like these because of the triangular-shaped base","broadcast_time":1399729685000},{"text":"A pair of Georgian candlesticks.","broadcast_time":1399729681000},{"text":"So overall, they're going to need their bonus buy and let's have a look at it.","broadcast_time":1399729679000},{"text":"I think ÃÂ£30-ÃÂ£50. Yes.","broadcast_time":1399729674000},{"text":"Might be atomising. Yes.","broadcast_time":1399729671000},{"text":"That's a bit strong. That's a lot strong. It's a big smell.","broadcast_time":1399729669000},{"text":"What did they pay for that? They paid ÃÂ£93, I dread to admit.","broadcast_time":1399729666000},{"text":"And lastly for them is this atomiser.","broadcast_time":1399729661000},{"text":"I can see that making 60 or ÃÂ£80 on the day with a bit of wind. Yes.","broadcast_time":1399729658000},{"text":"We've got to keep them on their toes.","broadcast_time":1399729654000},{"text":"Bit mean, 30-50. ÃÂ£55, they paid.","broadcast_time":1399729652000},{"text":"and I think they'll do all right.","broadcast_time":1399729649000},{"text":"and they're quite grand-looking pots. They're good.

It's quite sweet.","broadcast_time":1399729640000},{"text":"Next is the little condiment set.","broadcast_time":1399729636000},{"text":"cos that stuff's usually opalescent, not white.","broadcast_time":1399729633000},{"text":"I don't know about Powell and Co, I have to say,","broadcast_time":1399729630000},{"text":"ÃÂ£37.50 they paid. Mm. I mean, it's a novelty. Yeah.","broadcast_time":1399729627000},{"text":"but I see that making ÃÂ£20-ÃÂ£40, really.","broadcast_time":1399729624000},{"text":"Do you rate that? Well, it's decorative enough","broadcast_time":1399729621000},{"text":"First up, then, for the reds is this so-called Powell and Co novelty top hat in glass.","broadcast_time":1399729617000},{"text":"Lovely to be here.
